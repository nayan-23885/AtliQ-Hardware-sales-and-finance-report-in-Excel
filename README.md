# AtliQ-Hardware-sales-and-finance-report-in-Excel
This project involves analysing the sales and finance data of Atliq hardware using Microsoft Excel. While working on this project as a practice problem at the **Codebasics** Data Analysis course, I got to understand various key aspects of using Excel as a data analysis tool.

### 🚀 Key Learnings

✅ Advanced Formulas: Master lookup functions (XLOOKUP, INDEX & MATCH), conditional aggregation (SUMIFS, COUNTIFS), and dynamic arrays (FILTER, UNIQUE).

✅ Power Query: Learn to connect, clean, and transform messy raw data automatically (Extract, Transform, Load processes).

✅ PivotTables & Power Pivot: Use PivotTables for quick data summarization, and Power Pivot with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to handle massive datasets and build relational models.

✅ Data Cleaning Basics: Efficiently use Text-to-Columns, Flash Fill, Data Validation, and duplicate removal.

✅ Data Visualization: Build dynamic dashboards using PivotCharts, slicers, and conditional formatting to highlight key trends.

✅ What-If Analysis: Utilize Goal Seek, Scenario Manager, and Data Tables for forecasting and predictive modeling.

✅ Automation: Understand how to record Macros and write basic VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to automate repetitive formatting or reporting tasks.
